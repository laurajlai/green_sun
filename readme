## Welcome
Hello and welcome to Green Sun! We``'``re so excited to see you play this innovative Pygame platformer.  

## Running
To start playing from level 1, run:

```python3 menu.py```

and choose ``"``start``"``. 

(IN PROGRESS)
To start playing from any level, go to the levels page and select the level you would like to play.

## Different pieces
Player: This is you! 

Block: These are obstacles that come ``in`` different sizes. Do avoid running into them!

Key: Collect these at the end of the level to clear. 

Door: Run to the door ``in`` order to finish the level. Remember, you can``'``t leave without a key!

Gate/Button: Step on the button to deactivate the gate. Otherwise, you``'``ll just get thrown back.

Portal: Woah! Where did the door go?! These blocks transport you to different parts of the level. 

Flower: Picking one up allows you to jump further or higher. However, these are one-use only, so plan when you want to use them ahead of time.

Grow/Shrink: Pick up a shrink module to become smaller, or pick up a grow module to become bigger. These have unique interactions with certain other blocks.

Bat: Ahh! It``'``s alive! Try to not run into them.

Lava: Hot! Hot! If you run into fire without a sigil, you won``'``t be going much further. 

Fireproof Sigil: Possessing a fireproof sigil allows you to traverse lava without being burned. However, these are not permanent...
