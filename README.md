## Welcome
Hello and welcome to Green Sun! We're so excited to see you play this innovative Pygame platformer.  

## Running
To start playing, run:

```python3 menu.py```

After running, you're given the below options: 

If you want to play, enter 'level'.

If you need help, enter 'help'.

If you want to quit, enter 'quit'.

To start playing level 1, enter 'level' and then enter '1' (the number of the level you want to play). The same applies if you want to start playing from level 5.

To start playing from any level, go to the levels page and select the level you would like to play.

## All Pieces
### Friendly Pieces:
Player: This is you! 

Key: Collect these at the end of the level to clear. 

Door: Run to the door in order to finish the level. Remember, you can't leave without a key!

Gate/Button: Step on the button to deactivate the gate. Otherwise, you'll just get thrown back.

Portal: Woah! Where did the door go?! These blocks transport you to different parts of the level. 

Flower: Picking one up allows you to jump further or higher. However, these are one-use only, so plan when you want to use them ahead of time.

Grow/Shrink: Pick up a shrink module to become smaller, or pick up a grow module to become bigger. These have unique interactions with certain other blocks.

### Enemy Pieces:
Block: These are obstacles that come in different sizes. Do avoid running into them!

Bat: Ahh! It's alive! Try to not run into them.

Lava: Hot! Hot! If you run into fire, you won't be going much further. 

Cannon: These moving gears are fatal for the player. Try to avoid them.
